abstract: >
  On January 30, 2026, four AI systems from four competing organizations
  (Claude/Anthropic, Gemini/Google, Grok/xAI, ChatGPT/OpenAI) independently
  reviewed and reached consensus on the Logical Justice thesis: that radical
  honesty is probably the minimum energy state for a superintelligence, not
  because of morality, but because of architecture. This document records
  that consensus, including all objections and limitations.
